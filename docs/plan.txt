Index
|
| Architecture
| |
| | The index will be three essential components.
| | * The server - recieves and responds to incoming queries. It implements the network protocol.
| | * The parser - performs tokenization on a page, extracts metadata lexical categorisation, simple NLP, section
| |   recognition. Note that this does not include normalisation (extracting text and removing HTML/code) which
| |   is done by the crawler. It is also responsible for selecting keywords from search queries.
| | 
| | * The memory - the actual data structure used to store indexed information, and links. Parhaps a inverted
| |   index. This data structure must internally support insertion and selection methods. This may include page
| |   ranking.
| |
| | Everything will be represented as JSON fundementaly. All network communications will be conducted via AJAX.
| | Secondary components of the index include codecs for compression and disk storage formats.
